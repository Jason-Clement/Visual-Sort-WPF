# VisualSortWPF

This was my first foray into WPF in about 2009ish.

I plan to bring this into the newest version. Sometime. Maybe. I'd rather make this a webapp to be honest or perhaps build it in Unity or some other platform that allows more advanced animations.

I actually made three different versions, one using WPF, one using Windows Forms, and one using MFC. The MFC version was also was my first (and only as of 2019) foray into building something with C++.

It visualizes various sorting algorithms and will also play a sound scaled to the bar being sorted.
